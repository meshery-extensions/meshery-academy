description: Academy theme lab-intro shortcode for storing lab introduction content.
draft: true
---

The `lab-intro` shortcode captures its inner content and stores it for output elsewhere on the page, so lab introductions can be authored inline with the rest of the lab while rendering in a dedicated section. It emits nothing at the call site — the stored content is rendered by `lab-outro`, which must appear later in the same file.
