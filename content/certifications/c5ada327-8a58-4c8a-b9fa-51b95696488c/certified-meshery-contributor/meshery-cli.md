The Meshery CLI examination verifies contributor understanding of one of Meshery's core architectural components and is one of a set of mandatory exams comprising the Certified Meshery Contributor certification.

This exam focuses on the candidate's ability to contribute to the Meshery CLI codebase. The exam covers a variety of topics, including:

- [Meshery CLI Contributing Guidelines](https://docs.meshery.io/project/contributing/contributing-cli-guide) - Design principles and code conventions.
- [Contributing to Meshery CLI](https://docs.meshery.io/project/contributing/contributing-cli) - How to contribute to Meshery Command Line Interface.
- [Contributing to Meshery CLI End-to-End Tests](https://docs.meshery.io/project/contributing/contributing-cli-tests) - How to contribute to Meshery Command Line Interface end-to-end testing with BATS.

This exam does not cover Meshery CLI usage. For information on using Meshery CLI, please refer to the following resources:

- [Meshery CLI Installation Guide](https://docs.meshery.io/installation/mesheryctl)
- [Meshery CLI Commands](https://docs.meshery.io/reference/mesheryctl/commands)
