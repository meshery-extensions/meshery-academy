So it happened that the shipping industry was a big inspiration for optimizing IT infrastructure operations more than two decades ago.\nThe concept of a container to standardize the packing of goods, make them universal to handle and transport on different means of transportation to improve efficiency and reduce the transportation costs was a real success story for the transportation industry.\nReplication of success is always desirable and sparked a new way of operating IT infrastructures indifferent of application on development, testing, or production.\nContainer Technology in the shipping industry Instead of thinking up a separate way of shipping for each product, placing the goods in steel containers designed for pickup by the crane on the dock and fit into the ship is a more efficient way to do transport at scale.\nIn streamlining the processes and the loading of the goods in standardized containers, the goods can be moved as one unit in a space-saving and cost-effective manner.\nContainer Technology in the IT industry Computer container technology in the IT industry addresses similar challenges to steel containers in the shipping industry:\nincrease compatibility reduce dependencies develop, deploy and operate easier In streamlining the processes and the apps’ packaging in containers, deploying and running apps as one unit become a more performant and resource-effective process.\n","categories":"","description":"In this section, we explore the innovative concepts that have emerged in the world of containers, drawing parallels with the shipping industry to understand how these ideas can transform IT operations.","excerpt":"In this section, we explore the innovative concepts that have emerged …","ref":"/learning-paths/c5ada327-8a58-4c8a-b9fa-51b95696488c/example-learning-path/course-1/module/new-ideas-and-concepts/","tags":"","title":"New Ideas \u0026 Concepts"},{"body":" Packaging \u0026 Pricing 🔗 ","categories":"","description":"In this section, we explore the various packaging and pricing strategies for containerized applications, focusing on how they can optimize resource usage and cost-effectiveness in modern IT environments.","excerpt":"In this section, we explore the various packaging and pricing …","ref":"/learning-paths/c5ada327-8a58-4c8a-b9fa-51b95696488c/example-learning-path/course-2/module/packaging-pricing/","tags":"","title":"Packaging \u0026 Pricing"},{"body":" Container Benefits 🔗 dev and ops separation of concerns create application container images at build/release time rather than deployment time, thereby decoupling applications from infrastructure continuous development, integration, and deployment provides for reliable and frequent container image build and deployment with quick and efficient rollbacks – due to image immutability environmental consistency across dev, test, and prod runs the same on a laptop as it does on an on-premises server, virtualized server, and in the cloud\nOS distribution and cloud portability runs on Ubuntu, RHEL, CoreOS, on major public clouds, on-premises, and anywhere else\nresource utilization and isolation benefits higher efficiency and density due to better utilization and predictable application performance due to isolation\nloosely coupled, distributed, elastic microservices applications are broken into smaller, independent pieces and can be deployed and managed dynamically – not a monolithic stack running on one big single-purpose machine\nagile application creation and deployment increased ease and efficiency of container image creation compared to VM image use\napplication-centric management raises abstraction level:\nfrom running applications on an OS using virtual hardware to running applications on an OS using logical resources ","categories":"","description":"In this section, we explore the benefits of container technology, highlighting how it enhances development, testing, and deployment processes in modern IT environments.","excerpt":"In this section, we explore the benefits of container technology, …","ref":"/learning-paths/c5ada327-8a58-4c8a-b9fa-51b95696488c/example-learning-path/course-1/module/container-benefits/","tags":"","title":"Container Benefits"},{"body":" Frequently Asked Questions 🔗 ","categories":"","description":"This is the first challenge in the series.","excerpt":"This is the first challenge in the series.","ref":"/challenges/c5ada327-8a58-4c8a-b9fa-51b95696488c/challenge-1/faq/","tags":"","title":"FAQ"},{"body":" History of Application Deployments 🔗 Traditional Deployment 🔗 Early on, organizations ran applications on physical servers. There was no way to define resource boundaries for applications in a physical server, and this caused resource allocation issues. For example, if multiple applications run on a physical server, there can be instances where one application would take up most of the resources, and as a result, the other applications would underperform. A solution for this would be to run each application on a different physical server. But this did not scale as resources were underutilized, and it was expensive for organizations to maintain many physical servers.\nVirtualized Deployment 🔗 As a solution, virtualization was introduced. It allows you to run multiple Virtual Machines (VMs) on a single physical server’s CPU. Virtualization allows applications to be isolated between VMs and provides a level of security as the information of one application cannot be freely accessed by another application. Virtualization allows better utilization of resources in a physical server and allows better scalability because an application can be added or updated easily, reduces hardware costs, and much more. With virtualization, you can present a set of physical resources as a cluster of disposable virtual machines. Each VM is a full machine running all the components, including its own operating system, on top of the virtualized hardware.\nContainer Deployment 🔗 Containers are similar to VMs, but they have relaxed isolation properties to share the Operating System (OS) among the applications. Therefore, containers are considered lightweight. Similar to a VM, a container has its own file system, share of CPU, memory, process space, and more. As they are decoupled from the underlying infrastructure, they are portable across clouds and OS distributions.\n","categories":"","description":"This section provides an overview of the evolution of application deployment strategies, from traditional methods to modern container-based approaches.","excerpt":"This section provides an overview of the evolution of application …","ref":"/learning-paths/c5ada327-8a58-4c8a-b9fa-51b95696488c/example-learning-path/course-1/module/history-of-application-deployment/","tags":"","title":"History of Application Deployments"},{"body":"Welcome!
